Assignment 2: Simulating a Roller Coaster
Author		: Tianhang Liu
USC ID 		: 6902765566

Description: In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Credit Features: 
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher Y

2. Completed all Levels:
  Level 1 : Y
  level 2 : Y
  Level 3 : Y
  Level 4 : Y
  Level 5 : Y

3. Used Catmull-Rom Splines to render the Track Y 

4. Rendered a Rail Cross Section Y

5. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation Y

6. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) Y

7. Understandably written, well commented code Y

8. Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots Y

9. Attached this ReadMe File Y

Extra Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Render a T-shaped rail cross section -

2. Render a Double Rail -

3. Made the track circular and closed it with C1 continuity -

4. Added OpenGl lighting -

5. Any Additional Scene Elements? (list them here)

6. Generate track from several sequences of splines -

7. Draw splines using recursive subdivision -

8. Modify velocity with which the camera moves Y (Used equation listed in extras section)

9. Create tracks that mimic a real world coaster - 

10. Render environment in a better manner - 

Additional Features: (Please document any additional features you may have implemented other than the ones described above)
1. 
2.

Open-Ended Problems: (Please document approaches to any open-ended problems that you have tackled)
1.
2.

Keyboard/Mouse controls: (Please document Keyboard/Mouse controls if any)
1. a - start and pause animation
2. x - take screenshot
3. move mouse - rotate
4. CRRL + move mouse - tranlsate object
5. SHIFT + move mouse - scale object

Names of the .cpp files you made changes to:
1. hw1.cpp (I merged hw2 into hw1.cpp as suggested on hw2's description)
